# Proj1DataOpt2

This is one of two options, neither of which are fully fleshed out.

This option uses data from the Metropolitian Museum of Art. In its current state it takes two images and layers them on top of each other with some transparency. This mish-mash of art from different timeframes can serve as an inpiration for other projects.

The other option has thus far pulled a list of venues from the ticketmaster API. I had gotten stuck trying to pull from multiple pages an consolidating the infomration.

I got that piece done now and the next step would be mapping the locations. 

I also played a bit with my personal health sleep data and some other art APIs having a difficult time deciding and pulling something off.

I am looking forward to feedback on the two ideas that have made it the farthest to see what people think.
